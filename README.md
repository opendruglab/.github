## 🌍 About Us

**OpenDrugLab** is an open-source initiative combining **Artificial
Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Biomedical
Research** to accelerate **drug discovery, healthcare innovation, and
medical safety**.

Our vision is to create a **global collaborative platform** where
researchers, developers, and clinicians come together to make drug
discovery faster, safer, and more accessible.

## 🚀 Key Projects

-   🔬 **Molecule Property Predictor**\
    Predict solubility, toxicity, and drug-likeness of compounds.

-   💊 **Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Checker**\
    Identify risks of harmful interactions using graph neural networks.

-   🧪 **AI Molecule Generator**\
    Generate novel therapeutic molecules using generative AI models.
